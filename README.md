# Spawnable: A Smart Contract Automation Platform

## Summary

Developing smart contracts is often a daunting task for the average developer. Beyond merely crafting the core business logic, they must also manage a myriad of other responsibilities, typically through local scripts. This introduces unnecessary complexity, making the development process tedious and error-prone.

Enter **Spawnable**, designed with a mission: to provide the most seamless developer experience for blockchain environments the world has ever seen on [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com). All a developer needs to do is push their code to GitHub. With each commit, Spawnable takes the reins â€” it builds the smart contract in the cloud and automatically deploys it to both devnet and testnet. Want to launch on mainnet later? It's as simple as a one-click deployment using your [xPortal](https://xportal.com) mobile wallet or any compatible wallet.

The essence of an outstanding developer experience is allowing focus on the app's business logic without distractions. Spawnable achieves this, revolutionizing the way smart contracts are developed, making it straightforward, efficient, and frictionless.

## Business Case

### The Problem

Blockchain developers face complexities in smart contract management and deployment. Traditional methods are tedious, error-prone, and inefficient.

### Target Market

Spawnable targets both experienced blockchain developers and newcomers. From startups to established firms and independent developers, Spawnable is designed for anyone looking to simplify their blockchain workflow.

### Market Landscape and Spawnable's Position

While many tools cater to specific aspects of smart contract development, an all-encompassing solution is missing. Spawnable stands out by offering end-to-end automation, from GitHub integration to automatic deployments and intuitive UI generation. In a fragmented market, Spawnable emerges as a comprehensive, forward-looking solution.
